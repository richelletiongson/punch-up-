# punch-up-
This project is a stand-alone portfolio piece: an immersive parallax scrolling landing page for a tequila brand that I conceptualized and designed from scratch. The goal is to combine branding, product design, UI/UX design, motion, and frontend development into one cohesive digital product experience.

The site uses layered scroll interactions, animation, and subtle 3D-inspired effects to guide users through the brand story, flavors, and cocktail recipes. Rather than building a static marketing page, this project explores scroll-based storytelling as a way to create depth, atmosphere, and engagement.

This piece demonstrates:

- End-to-end brand creation

- UX structure and high-fidelity UI design

- Motion, product, and interaction design

- Frontend implementation (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)

The objective is to showcase my ability to design and build immersive, narrative-driven web experiences as a complete portfolio entry.
